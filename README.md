    ```bash
    nssm.exe remove WSLService
    ```

## How to register as Task Scheduler

#### To Install as Task Scheduler (<u>Recommended for windows 11</u>)

* Resolves WLS directory permission problem while accessing thru Windows 11 File Explorer.

2. Install [NirCmd](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html). Download form [nirsoft.net](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html) and install or install with following command. Windows administrator privileges are required.

    ```bash

    taskschd.msc
    ```
    
    ![](./assets/schtasks-install-step-00.png)
    
    `Create New Task`
    
    General Tab
    
    ![](./assets/schtasks-install-step-01.png)
    
    Triggers Tab

    ![](./assets/schtasks-install-step-03.png)
    
    Actions Tab
    
    ![](./assets/schtasks-install-step-04.png)
    ![](./assets/schtasks-install-step-05.png)
    
    Program/script: `nircmd`
    
    Add arguments: `elevatecmd exec hide "path/to/wsl-service/wslservice.bat"`
    
    Start in: `path/to/wsl-service`
    
4. If you want to execute manually for a specific purpose, or to create shortcut icon, use `wslservicetask.bat` file which run task registered at scheduler.

## Your own configuration

Default settings fie is `wsl-service/source/settings.json`. Copy to `wsl-service/settings.json` then config your own settings.

* `BINDING_ADDRESS`: Static local ip address for your WSL.
* `FIREWALL_ALLOWED_PORTS`: Automatic registeration on Windows firewall allowed port.
* `PROXY_FORWARDING_TCP_PORTS`: Automatic registeration on Windows proxy port forwarding.
* `INITD_SERVICES`: Automatically executes startup services such as ssh, nginx, mysql, redis, ...
* `INITD_EXECUTES`: Automatically executes additional commands on startup such as your own server.

## TODO

* Automatic Windows service registration.
